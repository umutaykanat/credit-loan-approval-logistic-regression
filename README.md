# Credit Loan Approval Analysis with Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bank marketing data to understand the factors that influence loan approval decisions. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Logistic Regression are used to model the probability of loan approval and interpret key drivers.

## 📊 Dataset
- Bank marketing dataset containing customer demographics, financial attributes, and campaign-related variables.
- Target variable: **Loan Approval (Yes / No)**

## 🛠 Methods Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
  - Accuracy & AUC

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain customer attributes significantly increase the probability of loan approval.
- Logistic regression coefficients were interpreted to understand feature impact.
- The model provides an interpretable baseline for credit decision-making.

## 🚀 Technologies
- R
- tidyverse
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- caret
- glm (Logistic Regression)
- R Markdown

## 📌 Why R?
R was preferred in this project due to its strong statistical modeling capabilities,
interpretability of generalized linear models, and rich visualization ecosystem.
